Tower Defense Battle Games
Battle Cats is a strategy game, but similar to a tower defense game. In each game, you have to organize a line of cats to protect the base while destroying the base types of exotic animals.
The game's control mechanics are quite simple; Just touch the chat icon at the bottom of the screen. The cat you choose is exported from the base and directed at the enemy to attack him
Initially, there were very few types of fighting cats. But over time, as you complete quests and level up, you'll unlock more powerful cats. Each cat has different fighting skills and you can upgrade them to give them more power.
This is necessary because you have to face stronger enemies and more power when the battlefield is enlarged. If your potential is weaker than yours, you obviously can't win.
However, you should also be aware that updating items and unlocking new cat characters costs gold. So try to complete activities and win to win lots of gold!
